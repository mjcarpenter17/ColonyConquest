## üü° **PHASE 3: UI SYSTEMS & TERRITORY INTERACTION** *(Days 4-6)*

### **3.1 Core UI Architecture** *(Foundation - Do First)*
*Create foundation for the right-hand side menu system. This will be four buttons that when clicked, will display the corresponding menu (ResourcePanel, ArmyPanel, DiplomacyPanel, ResearchPanel)*

- [ ] **3.1a** Create `src/ui/menu-system.js` - Right-side menu controller
- [ ] **3.1b** Create `src/ui/sliding-panels.js` - Panel animation system  
- [ ] **3.1c** Update CSS for right-side menu buttons and sliding panels
- [ ] **3.1d** Create base panel components (ResourcePanel, ArmyPanel, DiplomacyPanel, ResearchPanel)

### **3.2 Territory Selection & Info System** *(Builds on 3.1)*
*Implement the bottom-sliding territory information panel. When a tile is selected, the right-hand menus close and territory info slides up from bottom showing ownership, resources, and available actions*

- [ ] **3.2a** Create `src/ui/territory-info-panel.js` - Bottom-sliding territory info panel
- [ ] **3.2b** Update territory selection to trigger menu close + info panel open
- [ ] **3.2c** Display territory owner, primary/secondary resources, and basic stats
- [ ] **3.2d** Add territory interaction buttons framework (Attack, Build, etc.)

### **3.3 Resource Management Panel** *(First Complete Panel Implementation)*
*Implement the Resource Management sliding panel with worker training interface as shown in screenshots. This includes resource spending mechanics and worker management*

- [x] **3.3a** Basic resource display and collection system *(COMPLETED)*
- [ ] **3.3b** Implement Resource Management sliding panel UI
- [ ] **3.3c** Add worker training interface (matching screenshot design)
- [ ] **3.3d** Connect worker training to resource production increases
- [ ] **3.3e** Resource spending mechanics for territory claiming and training
- [ ] **3.3f** Territory claiming costs and validation system

### **3.4 Territory Attack System** *(Adjacent Territory Combat)*
*Create the territory attack system where players can only attack tiles adjacent to their owned territories. For now, attacking simply transfers ownership - later will launch battle scene*

- [ ] **3.4a** Implement hex neighbor detection for player-owned territories
- [ ] **3.4b** Add "Attack" button when adjacent enemy/neutral tile is selected
- [ ] **3.4c** Create simple territory capture mechanic (instant ownership transfer)
- [ ] **3.4d** Add attack cost validation and resource spending
- [ ] **3.4e** Visual feedback for attackable territories (highlighting adjacent tiles)

### **3.5 Additional Menu Panels** *(Complete the Menu System)*
*Build out the remaining three management panels: Army, Diplomacy, and Research & Tech. Create placeholder interfaces that will be expanded in later phases*

- [ ] **3.5a** Create Army Management panel structure and basic UI
- [ ] **3.5b** Create Diplomatic Management panel structure and basic UI
- [ ] **3.5c** Create Research & Tech panel structure and basic UI
- [ ] **3.5d** Add smooth panel transitions and menu state management
- [ ] **3.5e** Connect all panels to game state and resource system

### **3.6 Integration & Polish** *(System Completion and Refinement)*
*Finalize the UI system integration, ensure all components work together smoothly, and add polish effects like animations and responsive design*

- [ ] **3.6a** Ensure all panels work seamlessly with turn system
- [ ] **3.6b** Add keyboard shortcuts for menu navigation (1-4 keys for panels)
- [ ] **3.6c** Mobile responsive design for menu system and panels
- [ ] **3.6d** Add sound effects and visual feedback for all interactions
- [ ] **3.6e** Turn transition animations and UI feedback improvements

**Phase 3 Target:** Complete UI system with sliding panels, territory interaction, and basic attack mechanics

## üîµ **PHASE 4: ADVANCED FEATURES** *(Days 7+)*

### **AI System**
- [ ] **4.1** Create `src/ai/ai-player.js` - Basic AI decision making
- [ ] **4.2** AI personality system (Industrialist vs Warlord)
- [ ] **4.3** AI territory claiming and attack logic
- [ ] **4.4** AI resource management and optimization

### **Victory Conditions**
- [ ] **4.5** Implement territorial dominance tracking (80% control)
- [ ] **4.6** Economic victory condition (100 of each resource)
- [ ] **4.7** Victory state detection and display
- [ ] **4.8** Game over screen and restart functionality

**Phase 4 Target:** Complete AI opponent with victory conditions

## üé® **PHASE 5: POLISH & ASSET INTEGRATION** *(Final Phase)*

### **Visual Polish**
- [ ] **5.1** Integrate all PNG tile assets (Tile_01, Tile_gold, Tile_stone, Tile_trees)
- [ ] **5.2** Implement progress bar animations for training and actions
- [ ] **5.3** Add button animations and states (pressed/unpressed)
